                Question-1: What are the different ways to select an element in the DOM?
            </h1>
            <p class="pt-3  p-4 font-medium opacity-50 pr-20">
                There are several ways to select an element in the DOM. The most common method is getElementById(), which selects an element using its unique ID. Another approach is getElementsByClassName(), which retrieves all elements with a specific class name. Similarly, getElementsByTagName() selects elements based on their tag names.

                Question-2: What is the difference between innerHTML, innerText, and textContent ?

            <p class="pt-3  p-4 font-medium opacity-50 pr-20">
                TextContents is all text contained by an element and all its children that are for formatting purposes only.
                InnerText returns all text contained by an element and all its child elements.
                InnerHtml returns all text, including html tags, that is contained by an element.

                Question-3: What is event delegation in the DOM?
            </h1>
            <p class="pt-3  p-4 font-medium opacity-50 pr-20">
                Event delegation in JavaScript is a pattern that efficiently handles events. Events can be added to a parent element instead of adding to every single element. It refers to the process of using event propagation bubbling to handle events at a higher level in the DOM than the element on which the event originated.

                Question-4: What is event bubbling in the DOM?
            </h1>
            <p class="pt-3  p-4 font-medium opacity-50 pr-20">
                Event bubbling in JavaScript is a mechanism where an event triggered on a child element propagates upward through its ancestors in the DOM. It allows parent elements to respond to events triggered by their child elements.

                Question-5: How do you create, add, and remove elements using JavaScript?
            </h1>
            <p class="pt-3  p-4 font-medium opacity-50 pr-20">
                To add, remove, and modify HTML elements using JavaScript, you can use methods like createElement , appendChild , removeChild , and properties like innerHTML and textContent . For example, to add an element, you can create it using document. createElement and then append it to a parent element using appendChild .
